# Travel Agency - Proof of Concept
This project is a personal challenge, which consists of replicating a [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) design and converting it into a reactJS markup.

In this case, this project was taken from an [instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6IY47tBnb8/)
I changed the content with fake information about my country but with real images taken from unsplash. 

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
